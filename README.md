# Battery Management System (Passive Balancing)

## Project Summary

The project focuses on the design and analysis of a Battery Management System (BMS) with passive balancing techniques. BMS is critical for monitoring and managing rechargeable battery packs, ensuring safe charging and discharging by measuring parameters such as current, voltage, and temperature.

Passive balancing was chosen for its cost-effectiveness, although it has limitations such as energy loss through heat dissipation and relatively long balancing times. The system uses resistors and semiconductor switches to equalize the state of charge (SOC) among battery cells by discharging cells with higher voltage levels.

Key challenges addressed in the project include managing heat generated during balancing, limiting the balancing current to maintain safety, and ensuring compatibility between balancing and charging currents. The design emphasizes accuracy in measuring electrical parameters and suggests incorporating efficient cooling systems to mitigate temperature differences within battery packs.

The project highlights trade-offs between passive and active balancing methods, with active balancing offering faster and more efficient energy transfer but at higher complexity and cost. Recommendations include careful cell grouping, precise measurement and calibration, and selection of a cost-effective balancing method based on application requirements.

This work contributes to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of battery packs used in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and other critical applications.
